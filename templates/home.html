            <!-- Politics Simplified is a Machine Learning application to help the general public of Massachusetts become informed on various political candidates in local elections, specifically based on a userâ€™s topics of interest.  -->
            The world of politics can be overwhelming for most. With so many different sources to learn from, biases in the media, and countless candidates, voters are at a loss of who to cast their vote for when local elections pop up. However, in this day and age, it is vital that everyone who has the ability to, exercises their right to vote. To increase voter turnout and make voters more informed, we propose a website that simplifies the candidate research process by taking in the county of the voter and providing a range of different potential candidates along with their political profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Politics simplified uses webscraping and natural language processing to keep users like you informed! Based on your input of a political candidate and a location, our website will output a sentiment score which reveals whether the candidate has a positive, negative, or neutral presence on the internet.
